# LogBook

## Index

## Introduction:
LogBook is made to manage staff members in an organisation and to give a quick overview of their daily duties. The administrator may use this information to add or delete employees from their organisation and to monitor their productivity. Employees can add their daily activities to the LogBook and view their performance data as pie and bar charts on the dashboard. An employee can, however, also edit his or her profile. LogBook essentially gives you the ability to manage your staff whenever you want. Employee time monitoring is one of LogBook's key features. This helps you save time and money.

## Purpose of LogBook:
Employees at businesses and technical institutes set aside a significant amount of time, either in the workplace or at home, to prepare their daily, weekly, and other records. Using LogBook, employees and management may quickly create records since they have access to the information at their fingertips.

## Guide
Our app comprises of two processes, namely
- Frontend (React)
- Backend (Nodejs, Express, Mongodb)

So both the processes need to be running concurrently for the proper functioning of the app. We do so by following the following steps :
1. Download the folder on your local machine to whatever location you feel comfortable with as a zip and unzip it.
2. Create a new file in the folder just parallel to index.js named as “.env”  and paste the following line on that file ``   URI = "mongodb+srv://prasoonraj:prasoontan1@cluster0.psjnyyn.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority"    ’’ 
3. Open two concurrent terminals for two separate processes as discussed above, and move to the project folder on both terminals.
4. Run npm  install on one of the terminals, and then after that process, run npm start on it, which will run our backend Server.
5. On second terminal do “cd Frontend”  to move to our frontend server and type “npm install” after that is done type “npm start” to start our frontend server.
6. Move to any web Browser and go to “localhost:3000” you should be good to go.
